# Team Collaboration Protocols

## Communication Channels
- GitHub Issues: For bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions
- Pull Requests: For code reviews and implementation discussions
- Weekly Sync: Every Monday at 10 AM to discuss priorities

## Development Process
1. New features and bugs are tracked in GitHub Issues
2. Issues are assigned and moved to "In Progress" in the project board
3. Work is done in feature branches following the naming convention: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, etc.
4. Pull requests require at least one review before merging
5. After merging, the branch is deleted and the issue is closed automatically

## Code Review Guidelines
- Reviews should be completed within 24 hours
- Focus on:
  - Code quality and maintainability
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation
  - Performance considerations

## Release Process
1. Releases are created using the `npm run release` command
2. This generates a changelog based on commit messages
3. Releases follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
